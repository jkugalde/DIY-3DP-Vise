NOTES: 
- You can print the spacer (i put one in the .stls folder), i dont know where i got aluminium one that i used.
- If you cannot find low profile nuts, you can print the rubber plate2, which uses standard M5 nuts, but you will probably need a bigger bike tube.
- You can also replace the set screws with M3 not too long bolts.
